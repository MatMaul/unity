== Introduction

Unity version 2.x features major changes and requires some effort to perform upgrade from a 1.x version. This
document tracks all actions that may be necessary during upgrade.


=== Logging subsystem re-configuration

Unity 1.x used a dated log4j 1.2.17 logging library. Unity 2.x upgrades it to the most recent log4j2. Log4j2 uses 
a different configuration syntax. It is important to note that logging configuration file name is changed from 
+log4j.properties+ to: 

----
log4j2.properties
----
   
It is strongly suggested to use a new logging configuration file from Unity distribution as a template and 
only apply the local modifications. Typically it is only required to update logger levels to desired ones.

Note that basic concept behind logging (loggers, appenders) did not change.
