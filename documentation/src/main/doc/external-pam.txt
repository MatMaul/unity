[[pam-authenticator]]
=== Host OS PAM (Pluggable Authentication Modules) 

Credential verificator name:: +pam+
Compatible credentials:: +password+

PAM based authentication allows for authenticating Unity users against host Operating System PAM facility.
PAM is supported on Linux OS, and may be available also on other UNIXes. The integration is tested on Linux.

To be able to use host operating OS facilities, a proper native access library must be available among Unity 
libraries. 

TODO: how to configure architecture, including a new one


The typical authenticator's configuration will look as follows:

----
unityServer.core.authenticators.x.authenticatorName=pamWeb
unityServer.core.authenticators.x.authenticatorType=pam with web-password
unityServer.core.authenticators.x.verificatorConfigurationFile=conf/authenticators/pam.properties
unityServer.core.authenticators.x.retrievalConfigurationFile=conf/authenticators/passwordRetrieval-pam.json
----

PAM access is configured by providing a name of PAM facility that should be used by Unity and input translation profile
which should map information about authenticated user to Unity representation.

Example configuration in file +conf/authenticators/pam.properties+:

----
pam.facility=unity
pam.translationProfile=pam-profile
----

For such configuration Unity will authenticate against PAM using configuration from +/etc/pam.d/unity+ file.
Please refer to PAM documentation for details on how to create such file. An example (which is mostly default local 
authentication on Linux) can be similar to:

----
auth        required      pam_env.so
auth        sufficient    pam_unix.so nullok try_first_pass
auth        requisite     pam_succeed_if.so uid >= 1000 quiet_success
auth        required      pam_deny.so

account     required      pam_unix.so
account     sufficient    pam_localuser.so
account     sufficient    pam_succeed_if.so uid < 1000 quiet
account     required      pam_permit.so

password    requisite     pam_pwquality.so try_first_pass local_users_only retry=3 authtok_type=
password    sufficient    pam_unix.so sha512 shadow nullok try_first_pass use_authtok
password    required      pam_deny.so

session     required      pam_limits.so
-session     optional      pam_systemd.so
session     required      pam_unix.so
---- 

[IMPORTANT]
====
When using local file authentication in PAM (i.e. +pam_unix.so+) make sure that Unity daemon user is
allowed to read the +/etc/shadow+ file. Otherwise this method won't work. E.g.:

----
# setfacl -m u:unity-idm:r /etc/shadow
----
