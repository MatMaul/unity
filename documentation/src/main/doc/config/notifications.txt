=== Notifications and e-mail settings

Notifications and other messages are sent by Unity in several cases, for instance as an optional verification
step during password reset or to notify an administrator about a new registration request.

Currently the only notification channel available is the e-mail channel. It can be disabled 
by removing or commenting the e-mail configuration property in the main configuration file.
If enabled it is configured in a separate properties file. The default file provides a detailed information
on the available options so should be easy to edit.

The actual contents of the messages being sent is governed by the _message templates_. Message templates are
configured using Admin UI (Server management->Message templates). It is also possible to configure them with
configuration file (by default +msgTemplates.properties+), but this is much more difficult and not suggested.  
Currently a template is a named pair of two pieces of text: subject (title) and message body. What's more the template
can contain several variables which must be formated as:

----
${VARIABLE_NAME}   
----

Variables are replaced dynamically with concrete values when a message is prepared to be sent. Naturally
each subsystem sending messages provides different variables. Therefore each template must be associated with 
a concrete subsystem. This is performed in the template edit screen. The list of available variables for each 
subsystem is also provided there.
